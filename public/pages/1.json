        "Remove the contents from the packaging.",
        "Obtain a suitably sized cooking pot from your cupboard and fill it with enough water to completely submerge the holster. Place the water filled pot on the stove on high.",
        "Prepare your handgun by applying plastic wrap over the entire weapon and use tape to secure it in place.",
        "Apply the sight clearance tube over the front sight and align it along the center of the top to the rear sight and tape into place.",
        "Apply another layer of plastic wrap and tape into place.",
        "By now the water should be boiling. Using your choice of kitchen utensil grasp the holster and completely submerge it into the water for 3-4 seconds and remove.",
        "Being careful of the heat of the holster, insert the handgun with the stitching centered on the trigger guard",
        "Using the 'boning' tool, held at a 15-20 degree angle from the leather and applying firm pressure, begin to work the leather along the lines of your handgun. Form the leather to all major characteristics such as the ejection chamber, trigger guard, sight clearance tube and so on. This is where you can add your own personal touch by adding as much or as little detail as you would like. If you would like to add fine lines to mimic your handgun select a smaller rounded object to add the lines. However, the majority of the retention of the weapon in the holster is achieved by depressing the leather into the trigger guard from both sides as well as the ejection chamber. As the leather begins to harden make sure that it reaches a sufficient firmness to retain your handgun when turned upside down and shaken gently. Re-submerge in the boiling water if needed.",
        "Continue to work the leather to the handgun until you are satisfied with your creation. Leave the handgun in the holster overnight.",
        "Remove the plastic wrap and sight clearance tube. Apply a leather conditioner and enjoy."
